# Title : TBD

# Overview

The landscape of architectures that may be available to reach the exascale leads to increasing concerns regarding applicative performance. Whatever the design of these systems will be (heterogeneity, high core counts or depth of the memory hierarchy), it is admitted that co-design approaches will play a major role to adopt the next breakthroughs. Last few years, AArch64 architectures have gained traction with a growing number of silicon partner (Fujitsu, Huawei, Marvell …) and major deployments (Catalyst project, Sandia, CEA, Riken …).  On the software ecosystem side, optimized compilers and numerical libraries are now mature to support petascale simulations.


 Indeed, the HPC community is now able to have access to arm-based production platforms and research topics are emerging from early adopters.  Therefore, one of the key objectives of this workshop is to gather expertise from various research groups (runtime systems, linear algebra, operating system, performance modelling …) to discuss key features and shape next-generation applications.
