# Challenges  for runtime systems, programming models and applications on complexe SoC

# Overview

 With the advent of multi-core/many-core architectures, the core count increases up to 64+ core per socket. These sockets can be heterogeneous with integrated GPUs, FPGAs or NICs. The system on chip (SoC) architectures can be used from cell phones to HPC systems. In order to optimized the utilization of these SoCs, the applications have to use parallel heterogeneous programming models and rely on dedicated runtime.  These runtimes have to deal with the complexity of the SoC architecture in order to provide the best time to solution or power to solution depending on the needs.


The goal of this workshop is to is to gather and share the latest scholarly research from the community working on these issues, at all levels of the software stack. This includes, thread/task scheduling, GPU task engine, programming models and so on, from the runtime system to applications. We will also use panel sessions and keynote talks to discuss these issues, share visions, and present solutions.


 
 

# Topics of interest

For this workshop we welcome original work, presenting state of practice and state of the art and covering different aspects of thread/task scheduling, GPU task engine, programming models from system to application level for parallel applications on complex SoCs. We will also welcome surveys, position papers or standardization proposal. The workshop will cover the following topics :

* Scheduling on complex SoCs;
* Performance modelling; 
* Energy management;
* Communication progression;
* Runtime system/language/library interaction;
* Parallel programming model for heterogeneous systems;
* Co-design; 
* DSLs for complex SoCs
