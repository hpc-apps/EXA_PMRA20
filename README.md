# Challenges  for runtime systems, programming models and applications on complexe SoC

# Overview

The advent of multi-core/many-core architectures  with significant progress in chip manufacturing technology, . These sockets can be heterogeneous with integrated GPUs, FPGAs or NICs.In order to optimized the utilization of these SoCs, 

Indeed, the increase of the core count up to 64+ core per socket leads to many concerns regarding applicative performances. To squeeze the maximum level of performance out othese complexe SoCs, applications may rely on  parallel and heterogeneous programming models or dedicated runtime systems.  These runtimes have to deal with the complexity of the SoC architecture in order to provide the best time to solution or power to solution depending on the needs.

The objective of this workshop is to share latest updates on these issues. This includes, thread/task scheduling, GPU task engine, programming models or tuning of applications and algorithms. Panel sessions and keynote talks ¨will also be used to share visions.


 
 

# Topics of interest

For this workshop we welcome original work, presenting state of practice and state of the art and covering different aspects of thread/task scheduling, GPU task engine, programming models from system to application level for parallel applications on complex SoCs. We will also welcome surveys, position papers or standardization proposal. The workshop will cover the following topics :

* Scheduling on complex SoCs;
* Performance modelling; 
* Energy management;
* Communication progression;
* Runtime system/language/library interaction;
* Parallel programming model for heterogeneous systems;
* Co-design; 
* DSLs for complex SoCs
